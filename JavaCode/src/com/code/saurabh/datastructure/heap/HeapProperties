1. Heap is a special kind of balanced binary tree.
2. Heap data structure is of two types: min heap and max heap.
2.i)  In min heap, parent's key is always less than equal to all of it children.
2.ii) In max heap, parent's key is always greater than equal to all of it children.

Insertion basic logic
* Add new element in the end of heap (heap is usually built using array, not necessarily). 
If parent is less (in case of max heap) than new element than replace, else break

Removal basic logic
* Removal always happen from the root. Take last element from heap and place it on root.
Check if new element is not keeping heap property, if not then swap with child else break.
